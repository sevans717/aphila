Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

when working on phase plans, follow these guidelines:

1. complete every phase 100% before moving to the next
2. write detailed implementation steps for each phase
3. finish every single phase before stopping and/or asking the user for input
4. ensure backward compatibility
5. document all changes thoroughly at the end of the last phase
6. proceed, donâ€™t stop for picks or any other type of user confirmation actions
